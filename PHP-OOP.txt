-----| PHP - OOP Fundamentals 

1 - Class = Blueprint or template for creating objects
    
    class Person { 

      Properties
      Methods

    }

2 - Properties = Variables that are declared inside a class
   
    class User {

      var $user_name;
      var $user_age;
      var $user_email;

    }

3 - Methods = Functions that are declared inside a class

    class User {

      function sayHelloWorld(){
        echo "Hello World";
      }

    }

4 - Access Modifiers

    private   : Available only in parent class
    protected : Available only in parent class and child class
    public    : Available throughout the whole program

5 - Static Modifier = Static properties and methods can be used without creating an instance of the class
    Static keyword used to declare variables in a function which keep their values after the function has been ended

    class User {

      static $user_name = "Hassan";

      static function sayHelloWorld() {
        echo "Hello World";
      }

    }

    User::$user_name;
    User::sayHelloWorld();


6 - Constructor = allows us to initialize the properties of an object immediately after object creation
    
    class User {

      function __construct(){

      }
    }

7 - Getters / Setters = Methods that are able to get and set values

    class User {

      private $user_name;

      function get_name(){
        echo $this->user_name;
      }

      function set_name(){
        $this->user_name = "Hassan";
      }

    }

8 - Inheritance = Inheriting Properties and Methods from another class

     class Admin extends User {

     }
    
9 - Instantiating = Creating different instances ( objects ) of a class

    $user_one = new User();
